# Deployment Testing

## Overview

<!-- ***Replace*** with a quick primer on the importance of Deployment Testing - what problem is being solved and how our solution is 10x better. -->
When deploying models, it's hard to understand the impact a code changes will have on the data - especially for reviewers. With Deployment testing, you can get the full context of your changes, including downstream effects, directly within the PR.

## Getting Started

1. Connect your Data Source
2. Integrate with Source Control
3. Integrate with dbt Core/Cloud
4. [Optional] Connect Data Apps
