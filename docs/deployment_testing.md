# Deployment Testing

## Getting Started

To get started with deployment testing you need to do the following:
1. Connect your Data Source
2. Integrate with Source Control
3. Integrate with dbt Core/Cloud

Optionaly, you can also connect several data apps, such as Hightouch and Mode, to see the impact of downstream changes on these tools.If your team also uses data apps, such as Hightouch and Mode, you can integrate those to see the impact code changes have on these tools.
