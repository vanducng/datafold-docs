# Development Testing

## Overview

<!-- ***Replace*** with a quick primer on the importance of Development Testing - what problem is being solved and how our solution is 10x better. -->
When developing models, it's hard to understand how changes to your code impact the data it produces. Development Testing with Data Diff can bring more visibility to that process.

## Getting Started

### Open-source

<!-- ***Replace*** with a quick primer on how open-source solves the problem above. -->
Use open source data diff to get a summary of how the model you are working on compares to production - items like columns added/removed and the number of rows added/removed/updated.

1. **Install** data-diff
2. **Configure** your dbt Project
3. **Run** with --dbt

### Cloud

<!-- ***Replace*** with a quick primer on how Cloud build on open-source to solve the problem above. -->
Dive into the details with Datafold Cloud - like which rows were added/removed and how values were updated.

1. **Create** an Account
2. **Configure** a Data Source
3. **Generate** an API Key
4. **Run** with --cloud
