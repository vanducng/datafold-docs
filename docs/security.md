# Security

## Network Security & IP Whitelisting

As an additional security measure, your data warehouse may be restricting IP addresses with an allowlist. You may need to manually add Datafold's addresses in order to use our product.

### IP Whitelisting

For SaaS (app.datafold.com) deployments, you can whitelist the following IP addresses of Datafold:

* `23.23.71.47`
* `35.166.223.86`
* `52.11.132.23`
* `54.71.177.163`
* `54.185.25.103`
* `54.210.34.216`

Note that at any time, you will only see one of these addresses in active use. However, the active IP address can change at any time, so you should add them all to your IP whitelist to make sure there will be no service interruptions.
