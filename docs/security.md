## IP Whitelisting

If access to your data source is restricted to IP addresses on an allowlist, you will need to manually add Datafold's addresses in order to use our product. Otherwise, you will receive a connection error when setting up your data source.

For SaaS (app.datafold.com) deployments, whitelist the following IP addresses:

* `23.23.71.47`
* `35.166.223.86`
* `52.11.132.23`
* `54.71.177.163`
* `54.185.25.103`
* `54.210.34.216`

Note that at any time, you will only see one of these addresses in use. However, the active IP address can change at any time, so you should add them all to your IP whitelist to ensure no interruptions in service.
