# Why Datafold?

Datafold is the fastest way to validate dbt model changes during development & deployment.

With Datafold, data engineers can audit their work in minutes without writing tests or custom queries. 

When integrated into CI, Datafold enables data teams to deploy quickly and with confidence - leaving tedious QA and firefighting behind.
